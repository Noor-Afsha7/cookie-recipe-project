# 🍪 Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe Page

This is my **first ever HTML project**, built as part of the FreeCodeCamp Web Development course!

It's a simple recipe page that includes:
- A title
- A brief description
- An image of the recipe
- A list of ingredients
- Step-by-step instructions

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- HTML5
- Basic page structure
- Lists, headings, paragraphs, and images

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to structure a basic webpage
- Gained confidence building and uploading my own project
